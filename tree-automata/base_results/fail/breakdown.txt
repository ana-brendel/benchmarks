Reasons for failures:

le_n_S_79 - looking for implication lemma, no implication lemma created

le_antisymm_133 - needs antecedent to implication lemma that is not violated by examples

lt_n_Sm_le_342 - not sure why no ranked category 1 (seems like you could just apply lemma and then 
    apply hypotheses), also this is a case where the antecedent of the implication lemma synthesized
    is more complicated/restrictive than necessary (is redundant in this case)

le_trans_198 - needs implications to show transitivity
le_trans_172 - needs implications to show transitivity
