lt_le_S_136 - filtered out by script 

le_n_S_79 - looking for implication lemma, no implication lemma created

le_antisymm_133 - needs antecedent to implication lemma that is not violated by examples

lt_n_Sm_le_342 - not sure why no ranked category 1 (seems like you could just apply lemma and then 
    apply hypotheses), also this is a case where the antecedent of the implication lemma synthesized
    is more complicated/restrictive than necessary (is redundant in this case)

le_gt_cases_33 - proof state is the desired lemma, also lemma requires disjunction
le_gt_cases_138 - proof state is the desired lemma, also lemma requires disjunction

le_trans_198 - needs implications to show transitivity
le_trans_172 - needs implications to show transitivity

le_0_l_67 - no lemmas because only lemma synthesized is the goal state

max_le_Sr_0_86 - desired lemma is conjuction of goal state with something else (bad example)
